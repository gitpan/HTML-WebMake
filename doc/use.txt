use a WebMake plugin
</wmmeta>

WebMake supports ''plugin'' libraries, which are generally other .wmk files or
Perl modules which can be loaded to extend WebMake's functionality.

For example, there are standard plugins to provide support for ''download''
links, which allows links to files including their size, ownership
information, etc.; there's also a plugin which allows HTML tables to be
defined using a comma-separated value list.

It has one attribute, __plugin__, which names the plugin to load.

Plugins can be loaded from the WebMake perl library directory, or from the
user's home directory.  The search path for a plugin is as follows:

	- **~/.webmake/plugins/__plugin__.wmk**

	- **&wmdollar;{WebMake.PerlLib}/__plugin__.wmk**

The set of standard plugins are listed in the __Included Library Code__
section of the "index page" [$(index)].
