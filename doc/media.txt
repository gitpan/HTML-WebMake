load many URLs from one data source
</wmmeta>

WebMake allows you to refer to files and web pages symbolically, separating
the site layout from the URL structure, and avoiding later problems with
dangling links when a page's URL is changed.  This is done using <a
href=$(url_refs)>&wmdollar;(url_refs)</a>.

This works well for content items defined in WebMake, such as output files
defined using the <a href=$(out)>&lt;out&gt;</a> tag.  However it is not handy
when dealing with a images or other files that are not
generated using WebMake.

Therefore media files and external, non-WebMake files can be searched for
using the &lt;media&gt; tag, which allows you to search a "data source" [ds]
(directory, etc.) for a pattern.

	[ds]: $(datasources)

The attributes supported are listed on the "data source" [ds] page.

Note that data sources which do not map to files in a filesystem, or other
methods accessible to a web browser browsing your site, do not make sense for
the &lt;media&gt; tag; so, for example, the __svfile:__ protocol is not
supported, as a web browser cannot load an image from a CSV file. (yet.)

As a result, currently only one data source protocol can be used with the
&lt;media&gt; tag, namely __file:__.

<safe>
  <media src="file:images" name=".../*.gif" />
  <media src="file:images" name=".../*.jpg" />
</safe>
