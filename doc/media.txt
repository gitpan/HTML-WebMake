load many URLs from one data source
</wmmeta>

WebMake allows you to refer to files and web pages symbolically, separating
the site layout from the URL structure, and avoiding later problems with
dangling links when a page's URL is changed.  This is done using <a
href=$(url_refs)>&wmdollar;(url_refs)</a>.

This works well for content items defined in WebMake, such as output files
defined using the <a href=$(out)>&lt;out&gt;</a> tag.  However it is not handy
when dealing with a images or other files that are not
generated using WebMake.

Therefore media files, such as images, and external, non-WebMake-controlled
files, can be searched for using the &lt;media&gt; tag. This tag allows you to
search a "data source" [ds] (directory, etc.) for a pattern.

	[ds]: $(datasources)

    Note that data sources which do not map to files in a filesystem, or other
    methods accessible to a web browser browsing your site, do not make sense
    for the &lt;media&gt; tag; so, for example, the __svfile:__ protocol is
    not supported, as a web browser cannot load an image from a CSV file.
    As a result, currently only one data source protocol can be used with
    the &lt;media&gt; tag, namely __file:__.
