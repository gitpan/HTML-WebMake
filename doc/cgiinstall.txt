How to install the WebMake CGI script in your web server
</wmmeta>

To use this, copy or link ##webmake.cgi## to your web server's ##cgi-bin##
directory, and set it up as a password-protected area.  Here's how this is
done with Apache:

<safe>
  <Location /cgi-bin/webmake.cgi>
      <Limit GET PUT POST>
	Require valid-user
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName WebMake
	AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/conf/webmake.passwd
      </Limit>
  </Location>
</safe>

Next, create the file ##/etc/httpd/conf/webmake.passwd##. Example:

<pre>
  htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/conf/webmake.passwd jm
  New password: <em>(type a password here)</em>
  Re-type new password: <em>(again)</em>
  Adding password for user jm
</pre>

And edit the ##webmake.cgi## script, changing the value for
**&wmdollar;FILE_BASE**.  Only files and sites below this directory will be
editable.

Note that ##webmake.cgi## runs with the web server's username and password,
so you may have to ##chown## or ##chmod## files for it to work.

Supporting Metadata On Media
----------------------------

If you attach metadata (e.g. titles) to images or other media items using
##webmake.cgi##, it will write that metadata to a file called ##metadata.xml##
in the top-level directory of the site.  To pick this up, you will need to add
the following &lt;metatable&gt; directive to your site:

<safe>
	<metatable format=xml src=metadata.xml />
</safe>

Using CVS With webmake.cgi
--------------------------

Tt can be tricky setting up a CVS server.  To make things a little easier, a
step-by-step guide is provided in the <a href=cvshowto.html>Setting up CVS and
ssh for webmake.cgi HOWTO</a>.
