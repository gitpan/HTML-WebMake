Define several small content items quickly, using a table
</wmmeta>

Quite often, it's handy to define small (one-line) content items quickly, in
bulk, directly inside the WMK file itself.  The &lt;contenttable&gt; tag
provides a good way to do this.

Firstly, pick a delimiter character, such as ##|##.  Set the __delimiter__
attribute to this character.

Next, list a table of content names and their values, separated by a delimiter
character, one name-value-pair per line.

  __Note:__ if you would prefer to load the content items from a separate
  file, the "&lt;contents&gt;" [$(contents)] tag is better suited.

  __Another note:__ this is not the way to define data __about__ other content
  items (in other words, **metadata**), such as titles, authorship, or brief
  descriptions, as WebMake's built-in metadata support will not be available
  in that case.  Embedding the metadata into the content item using
  &lt;wmmeta&gt; tags, or loading them in bulk using &lt;metatable&gt; tags,
  should be used instead.
