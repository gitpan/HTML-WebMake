Some tips on using WebMake
</wmmeta>

Editor/IDE Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The root directory of the WebMake distribution includes a "Vim" [vim] rc file
to support syntax-highlighting for WebMake.  To use it, make a directory
called **.vim** in your home directory, copy it there, and add the following
lines to your **.vimrc**:

 au BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.wmk so &wmdollar;HOME/.vim/webmake.vim
 map ,wm :w!&lt;CR&gt;:! ~/ftp/webmake/webmake -R %&lt;CR&gt;

	Auto: [vim]: http://www.vim.org/

Once you do this, the macro sequence **,wm** will cause a rebuild of the site
which contains the file you're currently editing.

The Button
~~~~~~~~~~

WebMake now includes a WebMake button:

	<div align=center>
	<a href=http://webmake.taint.org/><img
	src=images/BuiltWithWebMake.png
	width=88 height=31 border=0 /></a>
	</div>

Feel free to include it on your pages; but please, if possible, add it with a
href to http://webmake.taint.org/, so people who are curious can find out more
about WebMake.

It's 88 pixels wide and 31 high, by the way.  If you look in the ''images''
directory of the distribution, there's also an 130x45 one and a 173x60 one.

To make things **really** easy, here's some cut-and-paste HTML
for the image:

 <a href="http://webmake.taint.org/"><img
 src="http://webmake.taint.org/BuiltWithWebMake.png"
 width="88" height="31" border="0" /></a>
