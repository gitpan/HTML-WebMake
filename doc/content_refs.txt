references to content chunks
</wmmeta>

Content chunks and variables can be referred to using this format.  This is
evaluated before any other variable reference is.

	**&wmdollar;{__name__}**

Content chunks can refer to other chunks, URLs, or use deferred references,
up to 30 levels deep.

Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to refer to a content item or variable, but are not sure if it
exists, you can provide a default value by following the content name
with a question mark and the default value.

	**&wmdollar;{__name__?__defaultvalue__}**

Parameterized References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Content references can also be __parameterised__ references; this means
that they act like function calls, in a way, allowing you to pass
in parameters.  They look like this:

	**&wmdollar;{__name__: __parameter__="__value__" ...}**

The parameters are declared in the XML style.

	**Note:** the parameters' values must not contain further content
	references, due to a limitation in the way WebMake parses
	content refs.  If you want to refer to a content item from
	within a template, pass in the **name** of the content item,
	and get the template to expand it; see the example below.

For example, if you set up a template item like this:

<safe>
	<template name="mytemplate">
		You passed in ${name}, and its value is \"${${name}}\".
	</template>
</safe>

and a content item like this:

<safe>
	<content name="foo">
		Hi, I'm foo!
	</content>
</safe>

Then a reference to:

	**&wmdollar;{mytemplate: name="foo"}**

will expand to:

	**You passed in foo, and its value is \"Hi, I'm foo!\".
