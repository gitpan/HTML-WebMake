references to content chunks
</wmmeta>

Content chunks and variables can be referred to using this format.  This is
evaluated before any other variable reference is.

	**&wmdollar;{__name__}**

Content chunks can refer to other chunks, URLs, or use deferred references,
up to 30 levels deep.

If you wish to refer to a content item or variable, but are not sure if it
exists, you can provide a default value by following the content name
with a question mark and the default value.

	**&wmdollar;{__name__?__defaultvalue__}**
