How to use WebMake as a CGI script
</wmmeta>

WebMake now provides some simple ''edit in browser'' functionality, using
##webmake.cgi##.

**Note:** this is beta functionality, and may have security implications.  Use
with caution!

Some features of note:

  - The default view is an overview of your site, allowing you to quickly find
    what you want to change.

  - webmake.cgi includes a rudimentary file manager, allowing you to travel
    through the directories that make up your site, and create, delete, edit
    and upload files therein.

  - Text and XML can be edited quickly, in a textbox, with built-in input
    areas for entering common metadata items (such as titles).

  - You can also use it to edit the items of content embedded in the WebMake
    file itself, or simply edit the WebMake XML file in a text box.

  - With a single click of a link, the WebMake site can be built there and
    then.

Also, webmake.cgi supports CVS, which provides these benefits:

  - multiple copies of the same site can be replicated, and changes made on
    any of the sites will be automatically updated on all the others.

  - changes made to the site will be kept under version control, so older
    versions of the site can be ''rolled back'' if necessary.

  - a history of changes to the site is kept, allowing you to see exactly who
    did what to which.
