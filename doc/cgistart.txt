How to navigate and use the ''edit-in-browser'' interface
</wmmeta>

First of all, after typing the ##webmake.cgi## URL, you'll see a login dialog:

	<div align=center>
	<img src=shots/login.png ${IMGSIZE} />
	</div>

Type your username and password, and (assuming they're right) you'll see
the __Choose Site__ page.  Choose the site (ie. the .wmk file) you wish
to edit and click on its **Edit** link.

	<shot src=shots/choose_site.png />

The site you've chosen will appear in the __Edit Site__ page:

	<shot src=shots/edit_site.png />

If you've set up CVS, it's probably good manners to ensure you do a __cvs
update__ immediately before changing anything.  If you click on the **Update
From CVS** link, you'll see the __CVS Update__ page:

	<shot src=shots/cvs_update.png />

Once this is done, click on the **return to WebMake file** link to return to
the __Edit Site__ page.

Editing Content Items
---------------------

If you have any items that contain text, such as &lt;content&gt; items, an
**Edit** button will appear beside them.  If you click this, you can edit the
text of that item, and any embedded metadata, in a textbox like so:

	<shot src=shots/edit_item_page.png />

This allows you to edit the text of the item, and even upload new text from
your local disk, if you so wish.  Hit the **Save** button to save the changes,
or just hit your browser's **Back** button to avoid saving.

The __Edit Site__ page doesn't currently allow you to create new tags
in the WebMake file, or change parameters to WebMake tags.  To do this,
use the **Edit This File As Text** link, which will present you with the
entire Webmake XML file in the __Edit Page__:

	<shot src=shots/edit_page.png />

Editing Directories
-------------------

WebMake tags that load content from directories, such as the &lt;contents&gt;
tag, appear with a link beside them reading **Browse Source Dir**.  If you
click this, you'll be presented with the __Edit Directory__ file browser
window:

	<shot src=shots/edit_dir.png />

This allows you to navigate about the directory tree (although you cannot
go above the directory you've named as **&wmdollar;FILE_BASE** in the
##webmake.cgi## script), and perform some other operations, such as
editing files in the __Edit Page__, create new files, and delete files:

	<shot src=shots/delete_file.png />

Building The Site
-----------------

If you click the **Build Site** or **Build Fully** links on any of the
pages, WebMake will build the site and present you with what was built
(and what went wrong, if anything did!):

	<shot src=shots/built_site.png />

Committing Your Changes To CVS
------------------------------

Once you're satisfied with the changes, hit the **Commit Changes To CVS**
link. This will, firstly, ask you for a message describing your changes:

	<shot src=shots/cvs_commit_msg.png />

And, once you've provided that, will send your changes back to the
CVS server.

	<shot src=shots/cvs_commit.png />

Note that WebMake tracks any files you've added or deleted using hidden CGI
variables, so once you've done a commit, you're given a choice between
clearing out this list (if the commit was successful), or keeping them (if it
failed in some way).
