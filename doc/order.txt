the order of processing
</wmmeta>

In order to fully control the WebMake file processing using Perl code, it's
important to know the order in which the tags and so on are parsed.

Initially, WebMake used a set order of tag parsing, but this proved to be
unwieldy and confusing.  Now, it uses the order in which the tags are defined
in the .wmk file, so if you want tag A to be interpreted before tag B, put A
before B and the right thing will happen.

Once the file is fully parsed, the <a href=$(out)>&lt;out&gt;</a> tags are
processed, one by one.  At this point, <a href=$(set)>&lt;{set}&gt;</a> and <a
href=$(perl)>&lt;{perl}&gt;</a> processing directives will be interpreted, if
they are found within content chunks.
