include another file into the current WebMake file
</wmmeta>

Arbitrary files can be included into the current WebMake file
using this tag. It has one attribute, __file__, which
names the file to include.

A set of libraries are available to include, distributed with
WebMake. See the __Included Library Code__ section of the "index
page" [$(index)] for their documentation.  However, these
should be loaded using the "&lt;use&gt; tag" [use] instead of this
one.
	
	[use]: $(use)
