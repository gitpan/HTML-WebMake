a relative path to the top-level of the site, for URLs
</wmmeta>

This URL reference always evaluates to a relative path to the top-level of the
site, for URLs.

Note that setting the **EtTextHrefsRelativeToTop** option will cause all URLs
in Text::EtText blocks, which don't start with a slash or a protocol
specification, to be made relative to the top-level of the site.
