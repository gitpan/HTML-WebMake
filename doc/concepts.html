                            Here's a list of the main concepts behind WebMake's design and implementation.
                            Before using WebMake, it'll probably help to have a read of this, so you
                            can understand where the functionality is coming from.

                              When you start working with the web, it's easy enough to write a few pages and
                               put them on your site. However, you quickly realise that they all look
                               different; there's nothing binding them together as one "site".
                              
                            </p>

                          <blockquote>
                            <p>
                              The next step is to add some common elements to tie the pages together, so you
                               add some header text or graphics, and maybe a table on one side listing the
                               other pages in the site, allowing your users to quickly find the other pages.
                               Maybe you add some information at the bottom of the page, describing who you
                               are, that kind of thing.

                              After a while, you'll have quite a few pages, each with a different piece of
                               <strong>main content</strong>, but a lot of them sharing some, or all, of the shared
                               elements -- the <strong>templates</strong>.

                              One day, you need to change the templates -- but there's no easy way to do
                               this, without manually editing each of the files and changing them by hand.
                               Wouldn't it be easier to just change this once, and be done with it?

                              That's one of the main features of WebMake: <strong>templating</strong>. It allows you to
                               define the templates in one place, then generate pages containing the
                               <strong>content</strong> wrapped in those templates.

                              There's quite a few products that do this; WebMake differs in that it's
                               <em>very</em> flexible in how you can include your content text in the templates.
                               Often, other products are limited to just setting a header and a footer to be
                               added to each page; WebMake takes its cues from traditional UNIX tools by
                               allowing very deep recursion in its templating, so your templates can include
                               other templates, etc. etc.

                              In some situations, you'll want to write HTML; but in others, text is
                               best, for ease of editing, and reading while you're editing. WebMake
                               supports <strong>Text::EtText</strong> and <strong>POD</strong> formats, converting them to
                               HTML on-the-fly.

                              <strong>Text::EtText</strong> aims to support most of the de-facto conventions we've
                               been using in mail and in USENET for years, converting them into HTML
                               in a sensible way.

                              Another annoyance comes from the default way a web servers serves web pages;
                               normally, each web page is loaded from a separate file.

                              This is fine for some sites, but in other circumstances you might want to
                               produce lots of small pages, or include identical text in several pages; or
                               you may just prefer editing your entire site in one editor, rather than having
                               to switch from one window to another.

                               and/or load content from a data source, such as a comma-separated values file,
                               a directory tree, or (possibly in future) an SQL database.

                               pleasing or descriptive. Or maybe some directive might suddenly appear,

                              WebMake accomplishes this using metadata; in other words, if you tag your

                               and its precedence compared to its neighbours (to specify the order of items),
                               WebMake can automatically use this information to generate the following maps:

                              WebMake includes a <strong>HTML cleaner</strong> which will rewrite your HTML until it
                               sparkles. It can also be turned off for a "HTML verite" effect, if you feel
                               so inclined. (Alright, it's also a little faster with the cleaner off. Not
                               much though ;)

                              You can define your own tags, similar to how JSPs support taglibs; this
                               provides a way to add scripted components to your pages, without
                               making things too messy or confusing, or arbitrarily peppering code
                               into the text.

                              Or, if you <em>like</em> peppering code into your text, WebMake provides support
                               for Perl code embedded directly into the text or WebMake file, similar to PHP,
                               ePerl, HTML::Mason, or ASPs. It also provides an API for that code to

                              Several other similar web site management systems revolve around dynamic
                               code running on the web server, which assembles the pages as they're
                               requested by the client. In the terminology used <a href="http://www.salon.com/contact/staff/idk/print.html">by Ian Kallen of

                              For most sites, the pages do not change based on which client is accessing
                               them, or if they do, they don't change entirely; perhaps an extra set of
                               links becomes available in the page footer allowing a logged-in user to make
                               modifications using CGI, or PHP or Perl code, but that would be it. The
                               page just isn't volatile enough to require continual re-generation for each
                               request.

                               memory for no real gain, and introduces yet another breakage point
                               (databases, memory usage, the /. effect...) where things can go wrong, just
                               when you're not looking at it.

                              WebMake takes the "baking" approach, generating virtually all its output
                               <em>before</em> the web server gets involved. The web site admin runs the
                               <code>webmake</code> command, and this generates the pages.

                               PHP, CGI, ASP or embedded Perl code can be used, and WebMake will not
                               interfere. In fact, a future version of WebMake will probably provide some
                               "fried" features of its own...

                              You can replicate web sites quickly, easily, and securely over the internet.
                               WebMake does this using CVS and SSH, two standard UNIX utilities that have
                               been used for years to do exactly the same thing for other types of data;
                               why not web sites?

                               conflict management, so users can edit a WebMake site at any replicated
                               point, check in the changes, and it won't overwrite everyone else's
                               modifications.

                              The WebMake distribution includes a CGI script which provides a simple

                               to be checked in to CVS. At the moment, it's not too user-friendly, so it's
                               not quite suitable for a newbie to use without some instruction -- but it's
