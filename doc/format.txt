the file format used for the .wmk file
</wmmeta>

Firstly, note that an WebMake site requires one or more WebMake files, each
one containing at least 1 &lt;webmake&gt; section.  Between them, there needs
to be at least one &lt;out&gt; section between them, otherwise no output is
generated.  Typically one or more &lt;content&gt; and/or &lt;contents&gt;
sections would be used, too.

The sections are specified using XML-/HTML-style notation, e.g.

        &lt;type attribute=val ...&gt;
        [ ...text... ]
        &lt;/type&gt;

WebMake uses the XML style of comments -- everything between
**&lt;!--** and **--&gt;** is ignored.

However, if this comment string occurs inside another WebMake tag body, it will
not be stripped, as this is the same format used by XML and HTML. To include
WebMake comments inside other tag bodies, use the alternative WebMake comment
format.

This comment format starts with **&lt;{!--** and ends with
**--}&gt;**.

Take a look at <a href=documentation.wmk>documentation.wmk</a> for a sample
WebMake file; this WebMake file is used to generate this documentation.
Alternatively, there's lots more on the WebMake website [site].
