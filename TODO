TODO LIST
---------

- allow generation of more than one copy of the same output file at the same
  time, e.g. for mirrors.

- Index pages often need to include an auto-generated abstract, e.g. the first
  paragraph of the text item. Provide a way to do this.

- Better way to include content item from just one file; see documentation.wmk,
  which uses <contents src=".." name="webmake" />.

- no warnings when sitemapnode sitemapleaf content items don't exist, there
  should be.

- Allow tranclusion of parts of other content items into the current one; ie.
  not just the entire text, but a range of paragraphs. Do this by (a) allowing
  refs to include a start and end range, maybe like: ${firsttime.txt:
  from=Grab_The_Pages_Text to=Convert_To_EtText} -- or look up XPath/XPointer.
  Current concept: ${trans from=content.txt start=name:startbit end=name:endbit}

- Redo WebMake site, or documentation, with multiple renderings; normal, "Palm
  version", PQA, etc., as a demo.  Nick templates from weblog package. ;)


IDEAS FOR NEW FEATURES
----------------------

- meta tags: implement visibility range, using W3C date and time format,
  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827: "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD".

- more web-based stuff, esp. edit-in-page a la EditTag.

- searching interface based on metadata.

- Sitemap writing as RDF, a la Dan Bricklin's paper:
  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2000/08/bized-meta/

- -w flag to produce warnings if deprecated (non-HTML4) tags are used?

- Look at WebLint to provide lint behaviour:
  http://www.weblint.org/doc/manpage.html

- MS: internal link verification.  Use LWP? and require a -w3 flag to do this.

- MS: external link verification.  Use LWP and require a -w4 flag to do this.

- MS: download time estimation. -w flag.

- MS: find files that are not linked to. -w2 flag.

- Wiki ideas: Map backlinks
  (http://www8.org/w8-papers/5b-hypertext-media/surfing/surfing.html) and
  recently-changed pages inside the site.  Generate pages to map this.  Each
  output page has a corresponding page for recent changes and backlinks.  (and
  content item dependencies as well maybe?)

- crit.org idea: Include a "check Altavista for backlinks" feature?
