Welcome to WebMake!
-------------------

WebMake is a simple content management system, based around a templating system
for HTML documents, with lots of built-in smarts about what a "typical"
informational website needs in the way of functionality; metadata,
sitemapping, navigational aids, and (of course) embedded perl code. ;)

It requires no dynamic scripting capabilities on the server; WebMake sites can
be deployed to a plain old FTP site without any problems.

It allows the separation of responsibilities between the content editors, the
HTML page designers, and the site architect; only the site architect needs to
edit the WebMake file itself, or know perl or WebMake code.

A multi-level website can be generated entirely from 1 or more WebMake files.
Text can be edited as standard HTML or converted from other formats, including
plain text (using the Text::EtText module).

WebMake is GNU software -- see the included file "LICENSE" for details.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
------------

WebMake works best with the following Perl modules installed.  It will work
without them, but some features may not be available.

Text::EtText

Required to use the "text/et" format for content items. Strongly recommended.

HTML::Parser

Required to support the WebMake HTML cleaner filter, which will clean up
your HTML for you.  Also provides the HTML::Entities module, required by
Text::EtText.  So if you don't have this module, you won't be able to have
your HTML beautified, or use the "text/et" format for content items.

Image::Size

Required to automatically add image size information using the
${IMGSIZE} tag.  If you don't have this installed, you won't be able to
use this magic variable.

DB_File

Provided with most UNIX versions of perl; more efficient than the other
supported database formats that WebMake will use if it's not installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For all UNIX platforms:
-----------------------

Untar the .tar.gz file, and "cd" into the directory. Then run:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install		(as root)

That will install the HTML::WebMake modules and the "webmake" command.

To install the optional modules, do this:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install Text::EtText
	install Image::Size
	install HTML::Parser
	quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Windows using ActiveState Perl or IndigoPerl:
-------------------------------------------------

Unzip the .zip distribution, and "cd" into the directory created. Then
run:

	perl windows_install.pl

This will generate some .bat files which allow you to run the scripts
from that directory.

If this command fails, you probably do not have Perl installed, or the
directory it's installed in is not in your PATH.  Check this and try
again.

Installing Text::EtText, Image::Size and HTML::Parser is a little more
difficult; it'll depend on which version of Windows Perl you're using.

For ActivePerl, the Perl documentation on the "ActiveState website"
[ActivePerl], provides information on how to use PPM to install Perl
modules.

IndigoPerl includes a pair of Package Manager applications which can
easily be used to install Perl modules. Check out "the IndigoPerl site"
[IndigoPerl] for more info.

Text::EtText can also be downloaded directly from the "EtText download page".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Windows using ActiveState Perl, or IndigoPerl, and NMAKE:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Another way to install WebMake is as a traditional Perl module, using
"perl Makefile.PL" and Microsoft's NMAKE, included with MS DevStudio.
Here's what one user has to say on this subject:

    nmake works nicely, and the installation process looks the same as on
    other platforms.

    My understanding is that nmake.exe is available for free from Redmond.
    In fact I downloaded it just a few minutes ago, following the
    suggestion found on the IndigoPerl home page:

      Installing CPAN modules requires that you have Microsoft DevStudio
      or nmake.exe installed.  If you are installing modules that contain
      xs files, then you need DevStudio, otherwise you only need
      nmake.exe.  You can download nmake from [the url below].

      Run the self-extracting exe and copy nmake.exe to the perl\bin
      directory.

[the URL is:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe
]

    Nmake15.exe expands to nmake.exe (64K) and Nmake.Err (5k) - a text
    file.  I copied both to C:\perl\bin, then renamed nmake.exe to
    make.exe and now I can pretend to be on Unix:

        H:\devperl\webmake\HTML-WebMake-0.5>makefile
        Writing Makefile for HTML::WebMake

	H:\devperl\webmake\HTML-WebMake-0.5>make ...

        H:\devperl\webmake\HTML-WebMake-0.5>make test
        ...

The upshot is: if you download NMAKE, rename it to "make.exe", and install
it in your path, Perl can install modules just fine using the traditional
perl module install procedure on Windows.  In fact, it may be possible to
simply use NMAKE as "nmake.exe" instead of "make.exe", from the look of
it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Macs using MacPerl:
-----------------------

(haven't tried yet. TODO)

You will probably need to install quite a few perl modules.  Start with the
CPAN-MAC set (see the MacPerl FAQ), and try to ensure you have the following
modules installed:

	HTML::Parser
	File::Spec
	Text::EtText	(optional)
	Image::Size	(optional)
